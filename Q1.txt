Difference between HTTP.1 vs HTTP.2

HTTP:
  - Hypertext transfer protocol.
  - It was used to send information from browser to server.
  - First usable version was created in 1997.

HTTP 1 :-
1. Compared to HTTP2, it is slower .
2. It loads the resources one after another. So if one resource cannot be loaded it will block the other one.
3. Compresses messages to make them smaller, and speeds up the performance
4. It doesn't have a push content, so information is sent to the client only if data is requested.
5. Uses plain text for communication
6. opens a new connection for each request

HTTP 2 :-
1. Faster as compared to HTTP 1
2. It allows multiple requests to be sent and received simultaneously, by splitting data into binary code messages
3. Uses HPACK to compress data by eliminating redundant information in Header packets.
4. It has push content which allows in sending data before a client requests.
5. Uses Binary protocol.
6. It supports persistent connection, which reduces latency.
